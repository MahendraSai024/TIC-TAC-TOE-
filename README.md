# TIC-TAC-TOE-
Sometimes the smallest step in the right direction ends up beign the biggest step of your life. Tip toe if you must, but take the step.


1. Objectives: 
 
My project name is Tic-Tac-Toe game. This game is very popular and is 
fairly simple by itself. It is actually a two player game. In this game, there is 
a board with n x n squares. In our game, it is 3 x 3 squares. 
The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be one of the players to get three same 
symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally - on a 3 x 3 grid. 

2. Theory of Game: 

A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usual games 
use “X”and “O”. If first player choose “X” then the second player  have to 
play with “O” and vice versa.  
A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his symbol (may be “X” or “O”) 
and his aim is to create a straight line horizontally or vertically or diagonally 
with two intensions: 

  a) Create a straight line before his opponent to win the game. 
  
  b) Restrict his opponent from creating a straight line first. 
  
  
In case logically no one can create a straight line with his own symbol, the 
game results a tie. 
Hence there are only three possible results – a player wins, his opponent 
(human or computer) wins or it’s a tie.
